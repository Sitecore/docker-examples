# Sitecore Docker Examples

This repository contains companion code for the [Sitecore Containers documentation](https://containers.doc.sitecore.com/). Together, these are meant to help you get started using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers with Sitecore.

Briefly, here's what you'll find in this repo:

* Example for running an out of the box Sitecore instance (see `getting-started`).
* Example solution for creating custom Sitecore images, with recommended folder structure for container development (see `custom-images`).
* Sample PowerShell scripts for container-based Sitecore instance preparation (`init.ps1`) and cleanup (`clean.ps1`).
* Docker compose files for building Sitecore instances in various topologies (see `custom-images`).

Please refer to the [Sitecore Containers documentation](https://containers.doc.sitecore.com/) for complete details, including running the examples and recommended usage.

## Steps to setup on the your local Windows machine:

1. Download and install Docker Desktop for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
	- See documentation to learn more: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/
2. Create a folder on your local drive, e.g. 'C:\Sitecore Headless'
	- Open the folder 'C:\Sitecore Headless' in Windows File Explorer
		- Open GitBash command prompt and execute the following git command:
			- git clone https://github.com/Sitecore/docker-examples.git
	- Open Windows Powershell as Administrator
		- Execute the following powersell commands:
			- cd "C:\Sitecore Headless"
			- Copy-Item "C:\Sitecore Headless\docker-examples\GettingStartedSetup\SetupDependecies" "C:\Sitecore Headless" -Force;
			- Copy-Item "C:\Sitecore Headless\docker-examples\GettingStartedSetup\SitecoreHeadless_WithContainers.ps1" "C:\Sitecore Headless" -Force;
			- powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file .\SitecoreHeadless_WithContainers.ps1 true true
				- Note the first 'true' param in the above command is for a $cleanInstall, i.e. removes the 'MyProject' folder instance created from any previous installation.
				- Note the second 'true' param the above command is for a $switchRunFolderSource (optional param), i.e. copies the content of the 'C:\Sitecore Headless\docker-examples\GettingStartedSetup\SetupDependecies\run' folder into 
				the newly created 'MyProject' folder instance created from this installation.
					- The $switchRunFolderSource param is only if you require custom 'run' folder scripts, 
					i.e. any script commands changes from 'powershell.exe -Command "& C:\tools\entrypoints\iis\Development.ps1' to 'powershell.exe -Command "& C:/tools/entrypoints/iis/Development.ps1'
						- Note this is only in instance when you windows instance an issue witht the backslashes in the script command.
